# Goals of the project
This is a personal project. My goal is to understand the elementary data structures and algorithms better by coding them in an object oriented manner.
I've chosen C++ because so far I enjoy the liberty of being able to do a wide scale of thing with a single language.

# The plan
To implement:
- Sorting
  - Quicksort ✔️
  - Mergesort
- Linked lists
  - S1L ✔️
  - H1L
  - C2L
  - Queue (w/ S1L)
- Binary tree

Items are continously added as I procede with the university course.
